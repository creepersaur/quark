# StyleSheets
If you've ever done web-dev before, you must know what `CSS` is. (Cascading Style Sheets).

Basically, in css, you define a file or style tag, which sets the properties for each element. You can even set properties for specific ClassNames or `class` attributes.

## StyleSheet
In Quark, we have the `StyleSheet` object. (I'll call it "Styles" for short).
```lua
local StyleSheet = Quark.StyleSheet
```
It's a function which takes the name of the style sheet. Then you can set the styles (properties) for each object.
```lua
local my_style = StyleSheet "Name" {
    TextLabel = {
        Text = "Hello",
    },
    TextButton = {
        BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(0,1,0)
    }
}
```

## Applying StyleSheets
Styles can be applied using `ApplySingle()` and `ApplyRecursive()`.
`ApplyRecursive()` will apply the style to all the descendants as well.
```lua
local New = Quark.New
local StyleSheet = Quark.StyleSheet

local my_style = StyleSheet "Button" {
    TextButton = {
        BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1,0,0)
    }
}
```
```lua
local my_button = New "Button" {
    -- Default properties hidden for clarity...
}
my_style:ApplySingle(my_button)
```
## Using Styles as Properties
Just set the Quark custom property `style` to the style object. (Like you did with `children`, but with `style`).
```lua
New "Frame" {
    -- Default properties hidden for clarity...
    style = INSERT_STYLE_HERE
}
```
It also affects all descendants.

## Getting Styles using names
Since you name styles when making them, it makes sense to be able to retrieve a stylesheet by its name. It's as simple as this:
```lua
local StyleSheet = Quark.StyleSheet
local my_style = StyleSheet "Hello" {
    -- Styles
}

Quark.GetStyle("Hello") -- this returns the style above
```

# Classes
If you've used `CSS`, you'd know what a class is. Basically, you can set a `class` attribute on an element and have access to that specifically in the stylesheet. It works the same in Quark, but it's just more verbose.
```lua
local my_style = Style "ClassTest" {
    TextButton = {
        -- Every TextButton will be red
        BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1,0,0),
    },
    [Quark.Class "menu"] = {
        -- Everything with the `menu` class will be green
        BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(0,1,0),
    }
}
```
```lua
New "TextButton" {
    -- Defaults...
    -- This will be RED
}

New "TextButton" {
    -- Defaults...
    class = "menu"
    -- This will be GREEN
}
```
## Multiple Classes
Classes can be divided by spaces. For example, `big red` is 2 classes, and `big-red` is one class.

```lua
New "TextLabel" {
    class = "big red"
}
```
## Setting Classes
You can either set the Class state itself, or use `PushClass(name)` to add a new class at the end of the current one. (Keep in mind, setting the class at this point in time does NOT revert the changes made, unless you have the previous class/ClassName in the stylesheet.)

```lua
local Button = New "TextButton" {
    class = "menu"
}
Button:PushClass("selected") -- adds selected to the Class
Button.Class("menu") -- sets the Class to `menu`
```

Styles as of now probably don't support States.
