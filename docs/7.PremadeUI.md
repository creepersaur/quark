# Premade UI

If you have UI made by someone else, you can still use it using Quark.

Just use the `New` function with the premade UI.

```lua
local Quark = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Quark)
local New = Quark.New

local Frame = path_to_frame

New(Frame) {
    -- Write properties here
}
```

*Note: This isn't tested for everything. It is intended that you create new UI using the `New` object and not to use premade UI like this. If you find bugs, report them, or create a pull request with the fix.*
