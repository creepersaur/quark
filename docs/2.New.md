# New

Creating UI objects (or objects in general) has never been easier.
The `New` function takes in the class name and returns a `New` object. You can call this object to set properties, create connections, and use custom quark properties.

```lua
local Quark = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Quark)
local New = Quark.New

New "TextLabel" {
	property = 100,

	connection = function(self, ...)

	end,

	children = {}
}
```

## Adding Children

You can use the following methods to add children after creating the `New` object.

- Push()
- PushChildren()
- Call the object again with `children = {}`

## 1. `Push()`
Takes a single Instance/New object and adds it to the children. (This also adds it into Cleanup).

```lua
local MyObject = New "TextLabel" {
	-- Defaults hidden for clarity...
}

MyObject:Push( Part )
MyObject:Push( New "UICorner" {
	CornerRadius = UDim.new(0, 10)	
} )
```

## 2. `PushChildren()`
Takes a table of Instances/New objects and adds all of them to the children. (Also adds them into Cleanup).

```lua
local Frame = New "Frame" {
	-- Defaults hidden for clarity...
}

Frame:PushChildren {
	New "TextLabel" {},
	New "TextButton" {},
}
```

## 3. Call the object again.

Just call the object and add the `children` Quark property.

```lua
local Frame = New "Frame" {
	-- Defaults hidden for clarity...
}

Frame {
	children = {
		-- Add children here
	}
}
```

You can also just call the `New` object as many times as you want since it just returns itself.
E.g.

```lua
local Frame = New "Frame" {
	-- Defaults hidden for clarity...
}
-- EVENTS
{
	MouseEnter = function(self, ...)

	end,
}
-- CHILDREN
{
	children = {}
}
```

## Getting the Instance of a `New` Object.

You can get the Object property of a `New` object. This is the Instance created when `New` is called.

```lua
local Frame = New "Frame"
Frame.Object:Destroy() -- Destroy the object
```

Wow, you can create objects now, this isn't limited to UI either.
What about making them reactive?
