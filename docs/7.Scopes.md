# Scopes

A scope can be thought of as a sandboxed environment where a copy of the original Quark module is created.
In a scope, calling `Cleanup()` will not cleanup all the components created with Quark. **But** calling `Cleanup()`
will cleanup every scope that descends from it.

Think of it this way,
> The king in chess has pieces that move on their own (components). But when the king falls, every chess piece also falls.

## Creating scopes

Calling `Quark.Scope()` will create a scope.
You can then call all the methods on the new scoped table instead of the original module requirement.

Here we have components which return Cleanup functions of their own:

```lua
local Quark = require( ... )

function component1()
    local Scope = Quark.Scope()

    Scope.New "TextLabel"

    return Scope.Cleanup
end

function component2()
    local Scope = Quark.Scope()

    Scope.New "TextLabel"

    return Scope.Cleanup
end
```

If we do something like,

```lua
-- Create a component
local my_component = component1()

-- Destroy component
my_component()
```

then only the component gets destroyed.
However, calling `Quark.Cleanup()` will destroy every component that was created.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When working with multiple files and components, it's useful to pass in a Scope to the component instead of requiring Quark again to avoid memory leaks and ensure module safety.
> It also helps with cleanup in general.

What if you already have some UI, and wanted to use it with Quark (perhaps with lower functionality)?
